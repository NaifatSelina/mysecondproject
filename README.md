## Project Aim
The main aim of my second project is to provide Spider-Man fans with a fun and interactive quiz that they can access whenever they want to test their Spider-Man knowledge. The quiz was made to be a quick and fun escape from the real world, into the Marvel universe for fans who need mind stimulating fun. I aim to use HTML and CSS to structure and style the quiz in a fun and inviting but still professional way whilst using JavaScript to add fun and interactivity to the quiz.

## User Experience

### Design Wireframes
For my second project I decided to carry out the initial designs on Figma, creating wireframes for desktop and mobile sized screens. The initial wireframes were created to help visualise the structure of the quiz however the ultimate structure and colour scheme of the quiz ended up being different to increase the accessibility and interactivity of the quiz. In the final design I decided to add the score board as a pop up screen and insert contact and help pages. This was to increase interactivity. The final layout of the quiz also has a sleeker and more professional feel and finish.

<!--webpage structure-->
### Webpage Structure
The Spider-Man Super Quiz takes on an easy to navigate structure. The quiz has been made to be accessible to users of all ages and therefore I decided to make the quiz page the default page to avoid over complicating and confusing the user. The quiz container contains the Main Title, stating that the quiz that is being played- the Spider-Man Super Quiz. Directly under, the user can see the Game Details which shows the player their score and what question they are on. Directly under follows the question and a choice of four answers, once the user has selected their answer they can click the next question button as continue. Once completing the quiz, a pop up appears on the users screen displaying their score details. Outside the game container, above the container three buttons can be found, a Contact button leading to a contact form page, an Audio button to control sound, and a help button leading to an instruction page. One each page that is not the default quiz page a button with a home icon can also be found to take the user back to the quiz.

## Reasons for Design

### Fonts
- To embody a comic feel to the quiz, for the main title of the quiz I decided to use Jolly Lodger for the font with sans-serif as the font that the browser can fall back on to if the browser used cannot support Jolly Lodger. The unique font is similar to the font used on the Amazing Spider-Man Comic covers therefore I knew it would be perfect for the title, Spider-Man fans will instantly recognise the style of font creating a positive feeling instantly. 
- Across the pages of the quiz, I decided to use Paytone One, once again with sans-serif as a font for the browser to fall back on if Paytone One is not available to the browser. I decided to use this font to create a contrast with the title font but also to add a professional look to the quiz. More so, using the Paytone One font mainly was a choice I made as the clean font is easier to read than if Jolly Lodger was used across the webpage, making the quiz more accessible, professional and clean.

### Colour Scheme
- For the quiz the colour scheme completely aligns with the colour scheme of the Spider-Man movies and comics. The quiz mainly occupies the iconic blue black and red colour trio that Marvel uses for Peter Parkers’ suit. These familiar colours create a positive and welcoming feel making users want to remain on the page and participate in the quiz. 
- The quiz title and text are white, this adds a fresh feel to the page and makes the text easy to read against the dark backgrounds that are red and blue/navy.  
- I decided to go for a darker blue for the background colours to make the quiz appear more professional. Spider-Man is an interest for individuals of all ages, my desire was not to make the quiz appear ‘childish’, the Spider-Man universe based in Queens portrayed in the movies has always had a dark undertone to it through the dark rainy scenes and characters such as Venom, I used the darker colour scheme to portray this darker theme and why I believe Spider-Man caters to older audiences as well as younger audiences. This also helped increase inclusivity of the quiz.

- In future webpages for mobile screens I would vastly simplify the layout of the quiz so the performance can be faster on mobile devices.

### Responsive Design Checker.

<!--bugs and fixes-->
## Bugs and Fixes

### Bugs Fixed
![bugs fixed](assets/images/bug.png)
- I encountered a bug in my html file due to not having any text in a heading tag, to resolve this issue I added an ellipses to not only fix this bug but to create the illusion of loading when the page starts up.

![bugs fixed](assets/images/bugs.png)
- I experienced a bug as a result of a stray end div tag, to solve this I simply removed the end tag.
- A bug had occurred in my html file due to the for attribute of my label not matching the input id, I resolved this by changing the for attribute to match the input id.
- I encountered a bug in my html due to a list attribute being present where not needed in an input element, I removed the attribute to solve the bug.

### Bugs Unfixed

## Acknowledgements
 I thoroughly enjoyed creating this quiz, it pushed me out of my comfort zone and although it was very challenging I feel very accomplished and proud of my work. I am so glad I was able to create something that incorporated Spider-Man, a much loved character to individuals of all ages. A much needed thankyou to my course coach Luke for the moral support, my mentor Seun for the technical support and to my family and friends for the continuous patience and support!
