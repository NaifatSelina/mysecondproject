# Spider-Man Super Quiz!- Project Portfolio 2- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
<!--summary paragraph-->
The Spider-Man Super Quiz is a fun and interactive quiz which has been independently built by myself. The aim of the quiz is for Marvel fans, in particular fans of Spider-Man, to test their knowledge on their favourite superhero- Spider-Man. The fun but professional and inviting structure of the quiz means it is perfect for Spider-Man fans of all ages and knowledge to get started on seeing how well their Spider-an knowledge really is.

## Project Aim
The main aim of my second project is to provide Spider-Man fans with a fun and interactive quiz that they can access whenever they want to test their Spider-Man knowledge. The quiz was made to be a quick and fun escape from the real world, into the Marvel universe for fans who need mind stimulating fun. I aim to use HTML and CSS to structure and style the quiz in a fun and inviting but still professional way whilst using JavaScript to add fun and interactivity to the quiz.
